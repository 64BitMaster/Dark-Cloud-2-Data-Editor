Hi, thanks for checking this little tool out! To run this, it SHOULD just as easy as unzipping your respective OS and opening the executable inside.

It'll ask you to select the 'cfg7' folder, which contains all the config files for the menus.

The files this tool reads from are comdat.cfg, comdatmes1.cfg, robodat.cfg, and wepdat.cfg.

If there's something this tool SHOULDN'T be doing, writing data to the incorrect sections or adding the wrong line ending etc., let me know! I can take a look at what's going and try to fix it.

If you have suggestions about the GUI, please let me know! This is the largest GUI project I've worked on alone, and I'd love feedback on it!

TO-DO:

- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I'm not sure, I think I've set out most of the things I wanted to do. This was more of an experiment to practice using GUIs, because I've never really done much with them before outside of classes. I have ideas on how the GUIs could be better optimized, but it would need a lot of rewrites to better organize things. The code behind it is MESSY, but it was never meant to be expanded beyond this so I don't mind it too much.
