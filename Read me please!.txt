Hi, thanks for checking this little tool out! To run this, it SHOULD just as easy as unzipping your respective OS and opening the executable inside.

It'll ask you to select the folder you have the 'comdat.cfg' and 'comdatmes1.cfg' files located, and once you select them it'll create a Backup folder in that directory to put copies of each file every time you save, just incase you need to revert back.

There's more than likely a few bugs still in here as this is definitely still a work in progress! If you see any weird quirks or flat-out wrong behavior, just let me know and I'll take a look at it!


If you have suggestions on future features, or comments on how the code is laid out or the GUI is assembled, please let me know! This was my first time working on a GUI, so I'd like to improve in the future!

Also, if you'd like to build this app yourself, all you need to do is run 'DC2ItemEditor.py' in a Python environment with the other two files 'DC2ItemGUI.py' and 'ItemDataReader.py' in the same folder and it should compile normally!

KNOWN BUGS:
- Backups don't work under Windows :(  It's probably something relating to permissions, but I haven't looked into it yet, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- There's probably plenty more lol

TO-DO:

- Add better handlers for when the app is given incorrect files, right now it just fails to load and I think just crashes, so I'd like to eventually have a try-except section to better protect against that situation

- I think when the app loads, if you try interacting with the editing menu before you select an item, it throws an error, but still continues running, so I need to eventually catch it

- I'd like to change the way the Save and Discard Changes buttons work so that you can only interact with them after you've made changes to be saved or discarded

- Refactor all the code around setting the GUI fields into simpler functions, because right now it's a MESS, and shouldn't require that many lines of code

- Maybe allow you to select the sprite sheet, and display the sprite of the item alongside the rest of the variables?

- Add more information on what the variables do, perhaps with tooltips when the user hovers over each field?

- Implement a '+' button to add a new item to the game! This would allow you to add items back in (at least to the debug menu), ESPECIALLY if they still have their name in the game, such as a Macho Sword!

- Add all weapon stats, ridepod part stats, and more!
